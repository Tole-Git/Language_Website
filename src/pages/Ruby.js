        <h3>Origin</h3>
        <p>First appeared in 1995, 27 years ago</p>
        <br></br>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Go was made to solve general slowness, complex type systems, slow compilation time, and inefficient multi-threading.Go today is used for highly scalable, concurrent, and parallel applications, Cloud-based or server side applications, AI, and data science. Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms. It was designed with an emphasis on programming productivity and simplicity. In Ruby, everything is an object, including primitive data types. 
It was developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan.
Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection and just-in-time compilation. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. According to the creator, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smalltalk, Eiffel, Ada, BASIC, and Lisp.</p>
